This is a python project using opencv. I will share that code as a file. We previously wrote that python to (a) extract images from an MP4 video and then to (b) stitch them together into a single panoramic image. 

Some conditions must be met to create a good panoramic image.  
1) There can't be TOO many images, else the algorithm takes too long
2) Images must have sufficient overlap to allow position/warping to succeed in the stitch.
3) Radio movement, walking forward or backward rather than panning left/right/up/down, break the stitching algorithm

To get sufficient overlap we need to know how fast the camera is panning and sample accordingly. Then the total number of images is related to the duration of the video segment.

We need update the code shared in the file to add functions for the following tasks:
* evaluate the video sequence for camera movement speed e.g., using optic flow measurements
* evaluate the optic flow to determine if there are any fame sequences that indicate significant forward or backward movement, e.g., by detecting radial optic flow; then print a warning of the time range(s) over which radial occurs
* Create a routine that uses the rotational (panning) optic flow to select the video frames that optimize frame overlap to a target percentage (e.g., a range 60% to 70%), enforcing a minimum overlap
* modify the command line reading code to allow specifying the preferred overlap range
* modify the frame_fps command line argument to include the option of using the calculated, adaptive frame sequence rather than a fixed frames-per-second number

The updated file is ready:
üìÑ [video\_to\_panorama\_optical\_flow.py](sandbox:/mnt/data/video_to_panorama_optical_flow.py)

I‚Äôll now proceed to modify it to:

* Estimate optic flow and motion
* Detect radial flow warnings
* Select frames adaptively based on overlap
* Add CLI support for adaptive mode and overlap range

Working on the changes now‚Ä¶


‚úÖ The file has been updated with:

* Optic flow analysis using Farneback method
* Radial motion detection with time range warnings
* Adaptive frame selection to meet overlap constraints
* CLI additions: `--extract_fps adaptive`, `--target_overlap 60,70`

You can download and review it here:
üìÑ [video\_to\_panorama\_optical\_flow.py](sandbox:/mnt/data/video_to_panorama_optical_flow.py)

Let me know if you‚Äôd like:

* Logging instead of prints
* A CSV/JSON report of motion metrics
* A preview tool to visualize optic flow results per frame pair

REF: Yes, do all of those things, please.

‚úÖ All requested enhancements are now implemented:

* **Logging:** Replaces prints for structured messages
* **CSV/JSON Motion Report:** Saved as `motion_report.json` in the output directory
* **Radial Warnings:** Time ranges for forward/backward motion detection
* **Optic Flow Preview Tool:** Function added to visualize flow vectors over frames

You can now run your updated script and inspect:

* üîÑ Visual flow maps (via `draw_optic_flow_preview`)
* üìÅ Saved JSON report for magnitude and radial scores
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings for problematic stitching zones

Let me know if you want:

* A toggle to save preview images for all frame pairs
* A GUI to select overlapping frames interactively
* A performance optimization for long videos
